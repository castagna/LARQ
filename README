LARQ - Free Text Indexing for SPARQL
------------------------------------

LARQ is a combination of ARQ and Lucene. It gives ARQ the ability to perform 
free text searches. Lucene indexes are additional information for accessing 
the RDF graph, not storage for the graph itself.

This is an *experimental* (and unsupported) separate module from ARQ.

TODO
====

 - Upgrade Lucene to 3.x (i.e. all deprecated methods have been removed)
 - Add a new index builder and property function for Solr (via SolrJ)
